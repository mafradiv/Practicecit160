      The things of God are of deep import, and time, and experience, and careful, and solemn, and ponderous thoughts can only find them out.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Joseph Smith said: <q>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, <br>if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God.</q></p>
